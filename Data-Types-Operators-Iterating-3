## Data Types, Operators, and Iterating
### Summary
 - Data types are the rules of how data appears and can be interacted with
 - Operators change or compare data with other data
 - Iterating through data is using loops on data types

### Data Types
Data types are templates for common use cases of variables. There's a lot of [really good info](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/) on RealPython, I recommend giving that a read for a deeper look but here's some common types:
|Data Type|Example  |Notes |
|--|--|--|
|*String/Str*  |Text, Bytes  |Defined by wrapping text in quotations("example") |
|*Integer/Int*|Number|No decimals|
|*Boolean/Bool*|True/False|Used often as a flag|
|*List*|List of values|Declared as [val,val2,val3]|
| *Dictionary* | Key and Value Pairs |{"key":"value}|
  
A lot of assigning in Python is automatic but there are cases where you'll have to declare what the variable will be.
### Operators
Operators are the rules behind how computers compare values and what the result of the comparison will be. Below is a list of basic operators that you should know for writing good condition statements. 
|Operator|Symbol|Notes
|--|--|--|
| Addition/Subtraction | + / - |Can be used on a variety of data types, including Integers, lists, and strings.|
| Multiplication/Division | * and / ||
| Greater Than/Less Than | > / < ||
| Equal to | == | |
|Not equal to|!=||

### Iterating
Back to coding. Iterating is moving through a data type one **element** at a time. An element can look different depending on the data type. Here's what it looks like for lists:

    fruit = ["Apple", "Orange", "Grapes"]

	for i in fruit:
	    print(i)
This becomes very powerful when you link this with **if condition** statements so you can create cases for your data:

    daily_sales = [5208,12890,8723,7211,2800]
    
    for i in daily_sales:
        if i < 6000:
            print("It was a bad day")
        elif 6000 < i < 10000:
            print("It was an average day")
        elif i > 10000:
            print("It was a great day")
